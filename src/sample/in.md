# Quadratic Equations

A quadratic equation is an equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{C}$.

## Discriminant

In mathematics, the discriminant of a polynomial is a quantity that depends on the coefficients and determines various properties of the roots. Its definition is:

$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$

## Roots

$x \in \left\{ \frac{-b + \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}, \frac{-b - \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a} \right\}$
