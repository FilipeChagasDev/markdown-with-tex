# Quadratic Equations

A quadratic equation is an equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{C}$.

## Discriminant

The discriminant is the horizontal distance between the vertex of the parabola of a quadratic function and the roots of the equation (when the result of the function is 0). Its definition is:

$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$

## Roots

$x \in \left\{ \frac{-b + \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}, \frac{-b - \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a} \right\}$
